# @seij/common-ui

Business-oriented UI components for Seij applications, built on React and
designed to sit on top of Fluent UI while keeping a framework-agnostic direction
for our other applications..

## What it provides

- Application shell and navigation building blocks.
- Form layout primitives and input controls (text, select, numbers, dates,
  months, years, money, percent).
- Data display components (tables, list view, badges, tabs, info/error boxes).
- UX helpers like loaders, inline edit, error notifier, and button bar.
- Basic i18n utilities and locale resources (FR/EN).

## Notes

- This package exposes UI primitives rather than a full design system.
